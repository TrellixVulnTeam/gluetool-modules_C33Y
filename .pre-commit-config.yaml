# To onboard:
#
# 1. install pre-commit app. This can be done either once, globally on your workstation,
#    or locally in your virtual environment (if you have such):
#
#    $ pip install pre-commit
#
# 2. install pre-commit hook in your working copy of a git repository:
#
#    $ pre-commit install
#
# From now on, git will run pre-commit hook before every `git commit`.
#
# See https://pre-commit.com for more information
# See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks
